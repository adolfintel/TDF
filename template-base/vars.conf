#For more info about possible values and details about how they work, see README.md here: https://github.com/adolfintel/TDF/blob/master/README.md#configuration-variables

#        [VARIABLES - Basic configuration]
game_exe=''
#game_args=''
#game_workingDir=''

#        [VARIABLES - Wine]
#TDF_WINE_PREFERRED_VERSION="games"              #games=Game-optimized build. | mainline=Regular Wine. | custom=The build in the wine-custom folder outside the system folder. | system=The Wine version installed on the system or mainline if not installed. Any other value will use system/wine-yourValue or system Wine if not found.
#export WINEDLLOVERRIDES=''                      #list of DLL/exe files to be loaded in this format: filename=n,b;filename2=n,b  (where n means prefer "native" windows file, and b means prefer builtin (the version provided by wine); d is also an option if you want to disable loading of a certain DLL/exe)
#export WINEDEBUG=-all
#export WINE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE=1               #Set to 1 to enable large address aware (>2GB RAM for 32-bit apps)
#export WINE_HEAP_DELAY_FREE=0                   #Set to 1 to workaround some crashes caused by bad memory management in some old games and applications.
#TDF_WINE_MAXLOGICALCPUS=0                       #The maximum number of logical CPUs (also known as hardware threads, the ones you see in task manager) that the application can use. If the number of logical CPUs in the machine exceeds this, TDF will limit how many can be used by the application assigning them "intelligently" to maximize gaming performance. Set to 0 to disable limit. Only supported by games build, other versions will ignore this parameter.
#TDF_WINE_NOSMT=0                                #1=Doesn't show hyperthreading/SMT to the application (if present on the system). Only supported by games build, other versions will ignore this parameter.

#TDF_WINE_PREFER_SAMESOCKET=1                    #0=Assigns cores exclusively on speed. | 1=Assigns cores based on speed, but first use all the cores on the first CPUs then use the others. | 2=Shows only the first CPU to the application and ignores the others. This can be useful if you're gaming on a multi-CPU server or something similar. Only supported by games build, other versions will ignore this parameter.
#TDF_START_ARGS=''                               #Additional arguments to pass to Wine's start command, such as /affinity 1.
